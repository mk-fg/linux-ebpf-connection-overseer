#  has linear scale with 123-9999 range, 123 there being 0% and 9999=100%.
# Special extra "range=N:M" can be added to the list to set opacity scale range manually instead.

# Can optionally be wrapped into "<flags>/.../" with "I/.../" for a case-sensitive lookup.
#  Wrapped re's can also be joined by " && " and negated by "!/.../" flag, e.g.: /rx1/ && !/rx2/
# Replacement can have "<flags>`<replacement>" format (with backtick separator in there),
#  with "g" flag to also group by replacement(s) (see rx-group below), or a digit to pick regexp
#  out of &&-joined ones to replace (default - last non-negated), e.g. "2`..." for second one.
#  Can start or end with \ (backslash) to keep leading/trailing spaces.

#  which can flicker with different connection info, as those get updates separately.
#  Regexps in [rx-proc] section can minimize that by e.g. making them look more samey.
# Similar to using "g`..." grouping flag for replacements in [rx-proc] section.
