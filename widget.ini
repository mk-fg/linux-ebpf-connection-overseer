# frames-per-second-max: SDL should vsync-cap fps to display refresh rate.
# This option allows to add delays to lower the number of updates, with 0 = cap to display.

# Can also be used with e.g. SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy which don't support vsync.

# line-height: can be either dot-number like 1.5 to use xN of font-size,

# line-fade-time: seconds to animate opacity of a specific connection line after activity.
# By default it's a "fade out" animation - transition from full 100% opacity to 0%
#   (i.e. full transparency) for the info line, and can be changed via line-fade-curve option.
# Restarts on new activity, i.e. when text of that connection-line gets updated.

# line-fade-curve: (time, opacity) points for cardinal curve for opacity change over time.
# This can define e.g. a fade-in or fade-out, some combination of both, flashing, etc.
# Should be any even number of space or comma-separated integer values, where each pair
#   is interpreted as an (x,y) point, with natural cubic spline in-between (easing transition).
# First and last points define which value would be considered 100% and 0% wrt time and opacity,
#   i.e. if first point is (567,9999) and last one is (839,123), then transition starts at 567
#   and ends at 839 (with linear time scale in-between), and opacity (RGBA pixel alpha value)
#   has linear scale with 123-9999 range, 123 there being 0% and 9999=100%.
# Special extra "range=N:M" can be added to the list to set opacity scale range manually instead.
# Use spline-editor.html in browser to generate/place/see any number of curve points interactively.
# Default is a simple "0,100 100,0" linear fade for pixel alpha channel values.
